## :scroll: Description
---
My app is simple to do list with only one activity to hold the list and one fragment to take the data from the user . The data are 1. Task Title
2. task Description
3. task Due Date
   the app will store these data in the Real time data base of the Firebase in addition to
4. Boolean variable to check if the task is done or not
5. Creation Date of the task
   ....
   The App also keeps track of the time of the task if it past the due date or not and the app has three color indacators around the border of any task
   Blue : The task in the schedule
   Green : The task completed
   Red : The task is past due date

## :bulb: Motivation and Context

My motivation was is to learn new technologies such as Firebase and working with fragments using 
Nav-Graph and safe args .. And I think I did it .. But I faced a lot of problems through the journey
